### Added
- **Global Command Palette**: Implemented a new command palette, accessible via \`Ctrl+P\` (or \`âŒ˜+P\`), for quick navigation and actions.

- **New Components**: Created \`ToastContainer.tsx\` and \`Toast.tsx\` to render notifications, with support for different styles (success, error) and icons.
